# CMD for Computer
 I create programs for the command prompt on various subjects

If you are using the programs for the first time you must

1) download the program you want (this should give you a command file)

2) open it as administrator and follow the procedure

3) read all instructions

4) if you must check boxes, check everything unless otherwise indicated
